# JavaScript Learning - Day 1: Introduction & Setup

## Welcome to Day 1 of Your JavaScript Learning Journey! 🚀
Today, we will cover the basics to set a strong foundation for JavaScript.

---

## ✅ What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language used to create interactive web applications. It is often used for:
- Making web pages dynamic (e.g., interactive buttons, animations).
- Handling user interactions (e.g., form validation, event handling).
- Fetching and displaying data from servers (e.g., API requests).

## ✅ History and Importance of JavaScript
- **Created by:** Brendan Eich in 1995
- **Original Name:** Mocha → LiveScript → JavaScript
- **Why Important?**
  - Runs in all browsers without additional setup.
  - Backbone of web development (along with HTML & CSS).
  - Used in **front-end (React, Vue, Angular)** and **back-end (Node.js)** development.

## ✅ Setting Up JavaScript

### 💻 You can run JavaScript in multiple ways:

### 1️⃣ Browser Console (Quick & Easy)
- Open Google Chrome
- Right-click → **Inspect** → Go to **Console**
- Type:
  ```js
  console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
  ```
- Press **Enter** → You should see `"Hello, JavaScript!"` in the console.

### 2️⃣ Using VS Code (Recommended for Projects)
#### Steps to Set Up VS Code for JavaScript:
1. Download & Install **VS Code** → [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Create a new folder, open it in VS Code.
3. Create a file named **script.js**.
4. Write:
   ```js
   console.log("JavaScript is running!");
   ```
5. Run it in the browser (linked to an HTML file).

---

## ✅ Running JavaScript in Browser
JavaScript runs inside an **HTML file** using the `<script>` tag.

### 1️⃣ Create an HTML file (`index.html`)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2️⃣ Create a JS file (`script.js`)
```js
console.log("JavaScript is successfully linked!");
```

### 3️⃣ Open `index.html` in a browser and check the Console (`F12` → `Console`).
